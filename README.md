# ⚡ **Voltage Underscaling CNN Accelerator Project**  

## 📌 **Description**.  
This project investigates how to **reduce the power consumption** of **CNN accelerators** using the **Voltage Underscaling** technique. This allows the accelerator to consume less power while maintaining the accuracy of the neural network, even in the presence of permanent memory faults.

### 🔹 **Project characteristics**.  
- ✔️ Simulation of the impact of **Voltage Underscaling** on different CNN architectures (AlexNet,Densenet,MobileNet,SqueezNet,VGG16, VGG19,ZFNet, ResNet, Inception, Xception).  
- ✔️ Modelling of **permanent memory failures** and their impact on CNN inference.  
- ✔️ Implementation of **error mitigation** techniques to maintain accuracy.  
- ✔️ Comparison of **energy consumption** before and after optimisation.

- ## 📂 **Project Structure**.
   
📦 The structure of the project is as follows: 

 1. `README.md`: The documentation file you are creating.
2. **`requirements.txt`**: Specifies the libraries and dependencies needed for the project.
3. 📁`models/`**: This folder would contain the pre-trained models you will use in the project.
4. **`scripts/`**: This is where the code that runs the simulations and analysis will go.
5. 📁`results/`**: Folder with the results obtained from the simulations or tests.
6. 📁`notebooks/`**: It will contain the Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualisation of results.
